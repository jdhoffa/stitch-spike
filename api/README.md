This directory (`api/`) contains the API service for the WebAPI proof of concept repository (poc).

NOTE: All commands in this README are written with the assumption that the working directory is `api/`, e.g. you have used `cd api` from the root directory of the poc repo, so that the context is exclusive to the API service.

## Set-Up

### Prerequisites

This project uses [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for environment and dependency management.

To install, follow the [official installation guide](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).

### Setup

1. Clone the Repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/RMI/web-api-poc
cd web-api-poc/api

2. Create and Activate the Virtual Environment

```sh
uv venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate # macOS/Linux
```

3. Install Dependencies

```sh
uv sync
```

## Running the API

### Locally serve the Fast API with:

```sh
uv run main.py
```

### Run Fast API in docker container with: 

```sh
# build the image
docker build --tag api .

# run the container in the background
docker run --rm --detach --publish 127.0.0.1:8000:8000 api
```

The API will be accessible at http://localhost:8000.

## Contributing

### Dependency Management

Dependencies are managed using uv. To add a new library, run:

```sh
uv add <library>
```

### Testing
 
Testing is implemented using the `pytest` library. Run all tests locally with:

```sh
uv run pytest
```

Or, you can run specific test suites with:

```sh
uv run pytest tests/test_unit.py        # to only run unit tests
uv run pytest tests/test_integration.py # to only run integration tests
```

For test-only dependencies, add them using:

```sh
uv add --dev <library>
```

### Linting

This project uses [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) for code formatting and linting.

Style code by running:
``` sh
uvx ruff format path/to/file.py # to lint a single file
uvx ruff format               # to lint the entire directory
```

Lint code by running:
```sh
uvx ruff check # check if all files pass the linter, and fix failures
uvx ruff check --fix # this will try to automatically fix linter violations
